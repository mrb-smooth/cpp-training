## 1. Matrix Multiplication

Given two matrices A (mxn) and B (nxp), write logic that computes the product of the two matrices. The matrix element is an int.

C = A x B

Where C is an mxp matrix.

- [x] Generate input data for A and B.
- [x] Validate A and B for dimensionality.
- [x] If valid, then perform the product of AxB and generate C.
- [x] Print out the three matrices in and row-col order on a terminal.
